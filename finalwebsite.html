            <p> I think that this article is very informative and helpful to those who are new to the field of programming. It gives a lot of insight on what to expect when you are a programmer. It also gives a lot of tips on how to be a better programmer. I think about this as the next step to evolution for humans. With AI becoming more mainstream nowadays, people should take it seriously and adapt on the changes or it will greatly impact their livelihood. We as humans should embrace AI and make good use of it and create more opportunities and innovate technology in the future. However, this does not mean that AI can replace humans because we can think critically and mostly guide the AI in what we want them to do. </p>
